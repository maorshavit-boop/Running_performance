## Overview
This project classifies runners into performance tiers (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) using running metrics and a derived General Running Performance Score (GRPS). It includes feature engineering, unsupervised clustering (KMeans), supervised learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and model evaluation.
